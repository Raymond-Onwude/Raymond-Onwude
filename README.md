# Raymond Onwude

**Finance Systems Architect | Fractional Finance & Treasury Advisor | Builder of DPIO**

I help organizations **answer the questions that matter most**:
- *Can we make payroll next quarter?*
- *Are we exposed in an audit?*
- *Do we actually know where the money is?*
- *If funding is late, what breaks first?*

I sit at the intersection of **finance, operations, and systems** — turning messy financial reality into clean reporting, forecasting, controls, and decision-ready dashboards.
