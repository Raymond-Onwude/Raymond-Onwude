# Raymond Okhia Onwude

**Financial Systems Architect & Treasury Advisor**  
Founder, **DPIO**

---

I design financial systems that make money **visible, controllable, and decision-ready**.

My work sits above bookkeeping and accounting execution. I focus on how financial truth is produced, structured, and trusted so founders, executives, and boards can make decisions with confidence under growth pressure, cash constraints, or audit scrutiny.

## What I Do

### Financial Systems & Treasury Architecture
- Cash-flow forecasting and runway analysis  
- “What breaks first” risk and liquidity scenarios  
- Ledger and chart-of-accounts design  
- Internal controls and audit readiness  
- Executive and board-level financial reporting  

### Business & ERP Systems Design
- ERP and accounting system configuration  
- System workflows that reduce manual risk  
- Financial dashboards and decision frameworks  
- Advisory support for pricing, growth, and operations  

I work with both **growing small businesses** and **mission-driven organizations**, operating in a fractional advisory capacity where senior financial clarity is required without full-time overhead.
